### Hi there 👋

I'm Rob, a Software Engineer specialising in Backend Web Development. I have over 9 years of industry experience working with NGOs, public sector research, corporate software R&D, consumer and sales tech. I've also worked as a Data Engineer before and I'm well versed in cloud technologies.

I like to work on data-intensive applications and enjoy providing insights and value from business data.
